            <h2>About the app</h2>
            <h4>What devices does the app work on?</h4>
            <p>The Guardian app works on phones, tablets, laptops, and PCs running Windows 10</p>

            <h4>Is the app available in all countries?</h4>
            <p>The app is available in most countries. For more tailored content, you can choose the UK, US or Australian editions of our content in the settings menus.</p>

            <h4>How can I change the size of text?</h4>
            <p>In any article, use the text-size buttons in the menu-bar at the top of the screen. This will change the size of the text in the main portion or the article. Your choice will be remembered for every article you then visit.</p>

            <h4>Can I personalise the app?</h4>
            <p>For the first version of our Windows 10 app we’ve prioritised making the best reading and discovery experience. The team is working hard on our next tranche of updates for the app which include breaking news, homepage personalisation, ‘follow’ notifications, a premium-tier for subscriptions, and more.</p>

            <h4>Why can’t I see Sudoku, or other puzzles?</h4>
            <p>We’re working hard to bring every piece of Guardian content to the apps. Currently there is a very small amount of non-written content that does not work on mobile devices. We hope to change this in the future.</p>

            <h2>Offline reading and data</h2>
            <h4>What content is available to read offline?</h4>
            <p>Almost all of our content is available to read offline. If you can see a link to a piece of content on the homepage or a section page, you should be able to read it offline. So simply open the app or visit a section to automatically cache all of the most recent content to read wherever you are.</p>

            <h4>How can I get the app to load new content to read?</h4>
            <p>Visit the homepage or any section or topic page. The app will check for new content and display a message if there are any updates. Just tap this to refresh the page. All the content will then be available, and cached so you can read it offline.</p>
