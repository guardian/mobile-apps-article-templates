            <h2>About the app</h2>
            <h3 id="about-01">What devices does the app work on?</h3>
            <p>The Guardian app works on all Android devices running Android 4 and up.</p>

            <h3 id="about-02">Is the app available in all countries?</h3>
            <p>The app is available in most countries. For more tailored content, you can choose the UK, US or Australian editions of our content in the settings area.</p>

            <h3 id="about-03">Why can&rsquo;t I see Sudoku, quizzes or polls?</h3>
            <p>We&rsquo;re working hard to bring every piece of Guardian content to the apps. Currently there is a very small amount of content that does not work on mobile devices. We hope to change this in the future.</p>

            <h2>Making your app more personal</h2>
            <h3 id="personal-01">How do I add content to my homescreen?</h3>
            <p>You can add any section, topic or contributor to your homescreen. Simply tap the home button&nbsp;next to the content you want. You can find the button at top of any section you&rsquo;re in, on a contributor&rsquo;s profile page, or on the right hand side of search results. This will add the section, topic or contributor directly under the top stories on your homepage.</p>

            <h3 id="personal-02">How can I rearrange the content on my homescreen?</h3>
            <p>First, open the &lsquo;edit homescreen&rsquo; option. You can do this directly from the homescreen by tapping the edit button, or via the settings menu. Then, use the small drag-handles on the left of each section to order them in a way that suits you.</p>

            <h3 id="personal-03">How can I remove content from my homescreen?</h3>
            <p>First, open the &lsquo;edit homescreen&rsquo; option. You can do this directly from the homescreen by tapping the edit button, or via the settings menu. Then tap the home button on the right of any section you want to remove. These sections are temporarily moved to the bottom of the list, so if you change your mind you can easily find and add them again </p>

            <h3 id="personal-04">How can I choose which notifications I get?</h3>
            <p>As well as breaking news, you can choose to get notifications from your favourite contributors, liveblogs, series, and football (soccer) teams and matches. To do this, just tap the notifications button.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>For contributors, open an article and tap on the contributor&rsquo;s name. The &lsquo;follow&rsquo; option is at the top of the page. This will send you a notification when that person publishes a new article</li>
                <li>Following a football team will automatically send you goal alerts when they score. Search for your team or tap on their crest on a football page. The &lsquo;follow&rsquo; option is at the top of the page</li>
                <li>Following a liveblog will send you a notification when a key event happens in that story. To enable this, tap the &lsquo;follow&rsquo; option near the top of any liveblog</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="personal-05">How can I manage or stop the notifications I receive?</h3>
            <p>You can manage your alerts&nbsp;from the settings area. Here, you can choose the alerts you no longer wish to receive or unsubscribe from all of them.</p>

            <h3 id="personal-06">How can I change the font-size of articles?</h3>
            <p>In any article, choose ‘Text size’ from the overflow menu, and then use the control to change the text. This will change the size of the text in the main portion or the article. Your choice will be remembered for every article you then visit.</p>

            <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
            <h3 id="subs-01">What do I get with a premium tier subscription?</h3>
            <p>When you subscribe to the premium tier you get:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access to the daily crosswords - available to play offline whenever you want</li>

            <h3 id="subs-02">How much does a subscription cost?</h3>
            <p>A premium tier subscription costs &pound;2.49&nbsp;(around $3.99) a month for new subscribers. Because of exchange rates, the exact amount a subscription costs varies from country to country.</p>

            <h3 id="subs-03">I had an old subscription, will this still work?</h3>
            <p>If you bought an auto-renewing subscription in the app before June 2014 this will continue to work, and at your original price too.</p>

            <h3 id="subs-04">How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>
            <p>You can cancel your subscription in Google Play. Choose ‘My apps’ in the menu, then the subscription tab.</p>

            <h3 id="subs-05">Can I use my subscription on more than one device?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Your subscription should work on each Android device you&rsquo;ve signed-in to using your Google account.</p>

            <h3 id="subs-06">I have a print+ Digital, or Guardian subscription. Can I use it to get access to the premium tier?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Simply open the settings menu, select &lsquo;Subscription&rsquo;, then tap on &lsquo;I am a Guardian subscriber&rsquo;.</p>

            <h2>Offline reading and data</h2>
            <h3 id="offline-01">What content is available to read offline?</h3>
            <p>Almost all of our content is available to read offline. If you can see a link to a piece of content on the homepage or a section page, you should be able to read it offline. So simply open the app or visit a section to automatically cache all of the most recent content to read wherever you are.</p>

            <h3 id="offline-02">How can I get the app to load new content to read?</h3>
            <p>On the homepage or any section or topic page, scroll up to the very top, then continue to pull down to refresh the content. You will then see the the loading animation while the app gets new content.&nbsp;All the content will then be available so you can read it offline.</p>
