                <p>Two poles that once hoisted a clothes line stand rusting and unused in Elsie Herring’s back garden in eastern
                    North Carolina. Herring lives next door to a field where pig manure is sprayed and the drifting faecal
                    matter wasn’t kind to her drying clothes.</p>
                <p>“The clothes would stink so you’d wash them again and again until they fell apart,” said Herring, whose family
                    has lived in Wallace since her grandfather, a freed slave, purchased land in the 1890s. </p>

                <p>“You stand outside and it feels like it’s raining but then you realise it isn’t rain. It’s animal waste.
                    It takes your breath away. You start gagging, coughing, your pulse increases. All you can do is run for
                    cover.”</p>
                <p>For years here in North Carolina - the second largest pork-producing state in the US - the pigs have been
                    outstripping the humans. They currently number around
                    <a href="https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/2016_north_carolina_animal_feeding_operations_bycounty.php#.WwQWE6kh1hA">38 to one</a> in Duplin county, with the impact, say local groups, falling disproportionately heavily
                    on African-Americans, Latinos and native Americans. But in the last few weeks, two court decisions may
                    have tipped momentum in a new direction, awarding compensation and bringing in new penalties for polluters.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>The pig farms of North Carolina produce around 10bn gallons of faeces a year, which is more than the volume
                    of waste flushed down toilets by the human population of Germany. The waste falls underneath slatted
                    floorboards and is discharged into murky lagoons that sit beside the barns. There are around
                    <a href="https://www.ewg.org/research/exposing-fields-filth/data-and-methodology#.WwQTZqkh3w4">4,000 of these cesspools</a> in North Carolina.

                <p>The sludge is broken down and sprayedonto nearby fields. In order to prevent ammonia washing off into water
                    systems, the liquid is sprayed on crops that can, farmers say, soak up a lot of nutrients, such as Bermuda
                    grass. Still, some residents, like Herring, have drinking water wells they’ve had to seal up. </p>
                <p>State regulators and the pork industry insist that a rigorous system of permits and inspections ensure that
                    this waste doesn’t spill from lagoons into waterways, or drift in a sprayed mist onto nearby residents.

                    said Rick Dove, senior adviser at Waterkeeper Alliance, who has campaigned against the hog facilities
                    for 25 years. “The industry has the choice to either put in proper technology to treat the waste or shut
                    down. If these judgments keep coming in they will face the situation the tobacco industry did and hopefully
                    they don’t want that.” </p>

                <p>The complaints are targeted at pork producer Murphy-Brown, a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods (owned by Chinese
                    conglomerate WH Group), rather than the individual contracted farmers who are nominally responsible for
                    waste management. Smithfield called the lawsuits “an outrageous attack on animal agriculture, rural North
                    Carolina and thousands of independent family farmers who own and operate contract farms.” It is appealing
                    the Kinlaw case and said it won’t consider settling the remaining litigation until the appeal is decided.

                    are disproportionately burdened by “grossly inadequate and outdated systems of controlling animal waste”

                    (a dialysis nurse) raise hogs for Smithfield and hope to pass their hog operation onto one of their four
                    children.</p>
                <p>“Farming is a way of life I’ve always known, tobacco used to be the money maker but it’s not now,” Sharon
                    said. “We want our children to know something else than punching a time clock. We feed the world. Bacon
                    comes from people like us and a lot of work goes into getting it onto the shelf. People forget that.”</p>

                <p>The Kings have a 200ft long tunnel-like barn containing around 2,400 hogs near Wallace. The pigs mill around,
                    occasionally drinking water from metal tubes that dangle into their pens. An automated system pushes
                    a corn and grain-based feed (Smithfield says it no longer uses antibiotics for growth) into troughs,
                    fattening the pigs for around 22 weeks until they reach “market” weight - around 300lbs (136kg). </p>
                <p>The swine scatter when the barn door opens but then approach visitors with curiosity, snuffling at the bars
                    that enclose them. Huge fans push air across the pigs, salving the North Carolinian heat and expelling
                    their fragrance out of one end of the barn. Neither the barn nor faecal lagoon are immediately unpleasant
                    to the nose and the Kings maintain they follow state rules around waste storage and disposal.</p>
                <p>In a state with a fetish for barbecue and foundational ideas of familial farming, criticism of the industrialisation
                    of hog farming is often met with reflexive, but polite, disagreement.</p>

                <p>“People don’t like me talking this way, I don’t get invited to many things any more,” said Don Webb, a former
                    hog farmer turned opponent of the industry. Webb, a former teacher who is 78, gave up his 4,000-strong
                    hog operation after complaints from his neighbours more than 30 years ago and has been tangling with
                    Murphy-Brown and its supporters ever since.</p>
                <p>“I got a call a few years ago saying ‘we will kill you, you goddamn nigger-loving son of a bitch’,” said
                    Webb, pulling out a revolver from his truck’s glove box that he said he carries for protection. Webb,
                    a tall man who sports red braces and a baseball cap, purchased around 450 acres he hoped to turned into
                    a campsite and line dancing venue, only for a hog farm to sprout up across the road.</p>
                <p>“I can’t use my property the way I’d like to, because of the odour,” he said. “These hog pens aren’t next
                    to country clubs, but we are asked to live in the third-world conditions with hogs and faeces. We are
                    humans, not animals. It’s wrong to stink up other people’s lives. God made it stink so we’d stay away
                    from it.”</p>
                <p>Webb said he raised the issue with Wendell Murphy, a farmer turned state representative considered the progenitor
                    of North Carolina’s hog warehouses, with no success. Political support for the industry is now entrenched
                    – a state bill passed last year limits the amount of damages paid to hog farm neighbours, meaning it’s
                    unlikely the $50m in the Kinlaw case will be paid out.</p>

                <p>A moratorium on new lagoons was put in place in 1997 and this has slowed the growth in hog farm numbers.
                    Still, more than 2,000 hog facilities remain in the state, with North Carolina’s Department of Environmental
                    Quality imposing fines for 76 violations over the past five years. </p>
                <p>Another complication is the lack of alternatives for the lagoons and field spraying – Smithfield agreed to
                    invest $17m in finding new technologies in 2000 and yet, nearly 20 years on, no single system has been
                    deemed viable as a replacement. In lieu of this, the company points to improvements in waste reduction
                    and schemes that would trap methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the lagoons and convert it into
                    energy.</p>

                <p>“It’s like a jigsaw puzzle that has to be put together all at the same time and we haven’t figured it all
                    out yet,” said John Classon, an expert in agricultural waste at North Carolina State University. “I’ve
                    been working on this for 20 years and I hope things will change before I quit.</p>
                <p>“Ultimately, I think Smithfield can do better and producers can do better but society has to bear responsibility.
                    We keep electing people who say they will reduce taxes to almost nothing and reduce regulations on businesses.
                    We are getting what we ask for.”</p>
