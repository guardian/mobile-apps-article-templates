                    <p>When I suggested I should write about Pinterest, the technology editor chortled in return: &quot;Everyone says It Is For Girls. You are a Girl. Therefore you are Perfect to do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And that's pretty much the perception of <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, the latest social media hot thing. The company was founded in 2008, and the site launched two years ago, but although it's been steadily gaining a foothold in the US, it has only just taken off in the UK.</p>
                    <p>The concept is clever and straightforward: users create &quot;pinboards&quot; of stuff they find around the web, arranged around themes. Think of an interior designer's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_board">moodboard</a>, and you've got the general idea. For now, it's invite-only, though you can request an invite via its login page if you don't have a friend already using Pinterest.</p>
                    <p>So what's it like to use? Well, clunky. And slightly annoying: it insists that you connect to it via either Facebook or Twitter, which means that if you don't want to share your &quot;pins&quot; (bits of content that you add to your boards) with your friends and followers then you'll have to turn off all the notifications after you've signed up. The sign-up process also insists on assigning a bunch of random people for you to follow, which means you'll have to unfollow them later if their boards don't appeal.</p>
                    <h2>Follower model</h2>
                    <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-image-386325960">
                        <a href="x-gu://gallery/https://mobile.guardianapis.com/img/static/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/2/22/1329895351309/Pinterest-Logo-001.jpg/6ce376c62a760411249fef0c2af8eaed?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}"><img src="https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/2/22/1329895351309/Pinterest-Logo-001.jpg" alt="Pinterest Logo" width="460" height="116" class="gu-image" /></a>
                        <figcaption>
                            <span class="element-image__caption">Pinterest Logo</span>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Its following and interacting model is a cross between Facebook and Twitter. Like Facebook, there's a symmetrical aspect: to interact with someone else's boards or pins, they have to follow you, and vice-versa: unlike Twitter, you can't interact with someone you don't follow. However, like Twitter, it's open and asymmetrical â€“ you don't have to follow back, and it's totally open; there is no option to hide your profile or any of your boards.</p>
                    <h2>Adding content</h2>
                    <p>You add stuff to boards either by uploading the link or by using the <a href="https://pinterest.com/about/goodies/">bookmarklet</a> available on the Pinterest site. It then offers you a series of the images from the page and a box into which you can add your comments.</p>
                    <p>There are a couple of irritations here: first, more often than I'd like, the site will announce that it can't find any images or videos and therefore it can't create your pin, even though the page you're looking at is brimming with images. Your choice then is either to abandon the pin, or do it the clunky way, which is to get a screengrab of the page, upload the resulting image and make sure you put the URL of the page in yourself.<br /> <br />Second, there's no text formatting, so any comment you add to your pin is a long stream of text: it would be nice to be able to add paragraph breaks, if nothing else.<br /> <br />You also can't pin anything from Facebook, which on balance I think is a good thing, even though you can of course screengrab and add the image that way. It should at least give users pause to think about the privacy of the friend whose content they are trying to pin.</p>
                    <h2>Sharing</h2>
                    <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-image-386325961">
                        <a href="x-gu://gallery/https://mobile.guardianapis.com/img/static/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/2/22/1329893281375/Screen_Shot_2012-02-22_at_06.25.17.png/f75b40d8729468566576328b067f352c?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}"><img src="https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/2/22/1329893281375/Screen_Shot_2012-02-22_at_06.25.17.png" alt="Pinterest screenshot" width="460" height="235" class="gu-image" /></a>
                        <figcaption>
                            <span class="element-image__caption">A screenshot taken at random on Pinterest's landing page</span>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Ah, yes, sharing content. Copyright is the big grey area on Pinterest: pins automatically grab an associated image that you may well not have any rights to reproduce.</p>
                    <p>Yes, the pin links back to the page you grabbed the content from, but that in itself could be infringing copyright. There's a <a href="http://pinterest.com/about/copyright/">copyright declaration on the site</a>, but it doesn't make any feint towards saying it will police content itself (meanwhile, Google runs algorithms to make sure anything you post to YouTube doesn't infringe copyright).</p>
                    <p>It has taken steps to <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/20/websites-block-pinterest/">allow website owners to restrict pinning</a> but as Pinterest grows, the prospect of responding to what could in theory be thousands of takedown requests a day could become overwhelming.<br /> <br />Once logged in, your landing page is a visual jumble of your pins and those of people you follow. It is a little overwhelming, and can be hard to find stuff you want to look at, especially if something is going viral: seeing the same image reproduced several times on a page is offputting. On the left is your activity feed, where you can see who's followed your boards, who's liked a pin, who might have repinned your pin (the same idea as Tumblr's reblogging).<br /> <br />I think this misses a trick â€“ if you click on a notification that someone has repinned one of your pins, it takes you to your original pin rather than the repin: to go on, you have to click twice to get to the repin, which in effect is a dead end â€“ it doesn't encourage conversation and interactivity as well as it might.<br /> <br />For me, that epitomises the clunkiness of Pinterest: it's just not easy enough to do the social bit of it. And the (potential) viral ecosystem therefore isn't quite working: when I post that I've started new boards on Twitter or Facebook, that seem to drive more traffic to me than organic discovery of my stuff by other Pinterest users.</p>
                    <h2>Love story</h2>
                    <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-image-386325962">
                        <a href="x-gu://gallery/https://mobile.guardianapis.com/img/static/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/2/22/1329901683989/Pinterest-cats-001.jpg/d223eeb03bab9ec38865b65059cf79fe?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}"><img src="https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/2/22/1329901683989/Pinterest-cats-001.jpg" alt="Pinterest cats" width="460" height="205" class="gu-image" /></a>
                        <figcaption>
                            <span class="element-image__caption">Pinterest cats</span>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>What I love about it, though, is how its limits are as wide as your imagination. Sure, there are a lot of mood boards and collections of images of expensive chairs. But I for one <a href="http://pinterest.com/misskatebevan/">am collecting different kinds of stuff</a>: I've got a board collecting <a href="http://pinterest.com/misskatebevan/wingnuttery/">examples of right-wing craziness from the US</a>, for example; and a <a href="http://pinterest.com/misskatebevan/books-i-ve-enjoyed/">board of books</a>. Oh, and a <a href="http://pinterest.com/misskatebevan/cats/">board about cats</a>, of course.<br /> <br />Brands, inevitably, love it, and Pinterest is a <a href="http://blog.shareaholic.com/2012/01/pinterest-referral-traffic/">very strong driver of referrals</a>, which gives a clue as to how it plans to monetise â€“ always a tricky issue for social media services that aren't Facebook or Google+. Until recently, Pinterest was <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/pinterest-skimlinks-affiliate-links/39906/">quietly using Skimlinks</a> to generate income from links posted by users to products. A bit of a fuss ensued, and <a href="http://pinterest.com/about/help/">Pinterest dropped Skimlinks</a>, saying: &quot;Right now, we are focused on growing Pinterest and making it more valuable. To fund these efforts, we have taken outside investment from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. In the past, we've tested a few different approaches to making money such as affiliate links. We might also try adding advertisements, but we haven't done this yet.&quot;</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>As a user, I like it a lot, though I have some reservations about the smoothness of its interactivity. And like many new web services that suddenly take off, the infrastructure often creaks: I hope Pinterest will be ramping up its server capacity soon. What I like about it is its visual appeal and how the only limits to what you collect are those imposed by your vision. </p>
                    <p>It might be a bit girlie to look at, especially when you arrive at a random page full of interior design or fashion boards, but it's definitely not Just For Girls.</p>
