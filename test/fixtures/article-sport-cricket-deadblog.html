                              <p>An impossibly hot fourth day in Sydney that <a href="x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/weather/2018/jan/07/sydney-records-hottest-day-as-temperatures-reach-47c-in-penrith">produced a record high</a> of 47.3C (117.1F) in the city ended with Steve Smith’s hosts on course for a 4-0 series win.</p>

                              <p>“A series like this does expose issues in your team,” said Farbrace. “And we have a choice. You either churn out some positive stuff, or we be honest and say that there are certain areas that are not good enough. That’s every single one of us – players, staff, structures, setup. Everybody needs to look very closely and ask if we have got the right people in the right places.”</p>

                           <p>Yes, good morning or other times of day to you all. I’ve been following the middle three days of this Test from my sick bed inside a whorl of fever dreams. I had the distinct thought yesterday that while I’d had an utterly miserable three days, it still wasn’t as bad as the England cricket team’s. Then it turns out that we have actually shared the experience of vomiting and nausea and hospitalisation in Sydney. After being on the field for most of the day in extreme 40+ degree heat, Joe Root got extremely ill overnight with dehydration and went into hospital at 7 this morning. He’s getting IV drips and all that, and a statement will be made later as to whether he’ll take any part to play. Perhaps it will be a Graeme Smith situation, where he’ll only come back later if there’s some chance of saving the match. Or perhaps they’ll just sack it off as a bad lot. This tour has not been kind to England in any way. <br></p>

                           <p>Plenty of discussion around now about whether cricket should have a maximum permitted temperature. While the Sydney bureau stations were reading in the 40s, those are the measurements taken in the shade. Anecdotally, the readings in the middle of the SCG yesterday were above 50 degrees. It does seem absurd to ask athletes to perform in those conditions. It seems absurd to ask spectators to sit around in those conditions too. It’s true that cricket already has annoying delays for rain and light, but in the far more dangerous conditions of extreme heat, it’s hard to mount much of an argument against it.<br></p>

I was hoping to push through, for one last hurrah on the Ashes OBO, because I’ve had such fun with you all throughout the series. Signing it off on the last day would have been grand. But medical necessity does not permit sentiment. Adam Collins is luckily on hand to take over from this invalid, and I shall continue back to my Swiss sanatorium.

                           <p><strong>Morning! </strong>Yes, Geoff is not a well boy. As those who have heard his voice know, when he talks it booms. Today, you can barely hear him. Back to the sick bay. Wish him well. <br></p>
                           <p>Speaking of health, the good(ish) news for England is that <strong>Joe Root is on his way to the SCG</strong>. The England camp have clarified that <strong>he will not bat when play resumes</strong> in 20 minutes, but the fact that he is here and not hospital is a good development. </p>
                           <p>This episode will, and should, prompt a conversation about playing in extreme heat. When the Australian Open tennis begins next week, they will be off the moment the tempterature hits 38 degrees. Has been that way for a generation or more. </p>
                           <p>But on our game, we celebrate these moments. How ill Dean Jones was during his 210 during the 1986 Tied Test has served as the ultimate proof his bravery. When Pete Handscomb nearly collapsed in Chittagong in September it was much the same.<br></p>
                           <p>There are many other examples, of course. I remember Ricky Ponting batting without a helmet in 2002 in Sharjah against Pakistan because the heat was so intense. Copped a whack in the face from a bouncer for his trouble. In short: let’s get this right.<br></p>

                           <p><strong>It is likely that Joe will bat today. </strong>That’s the latest from the England camp. We’re back in five minutes. Before it gets overtaken by events, my bit from last night on the Marsh brothers. I knew that line of commentary from Gerard Whateley would come in handy again at some stage. </p>

                           <p><strong>Moeen is the new man to the crease. </strong>Joining YJB, who resumes on 17. To repeat the news from this morning: Joe Root has been in hospital overnight with severe dehydration, but he’s at the SCG and expected to bat later on. Josh Hazlewood has the ball in his hand from the Paddington End. <strong>Play! </strong> <br></p>

Jerusalem belted out by the Barmy Army. Couple of slips, a gully and a catching cover in place. As usual, the Australian quick is right on the money. Bairstow defending and watching. Root has a hospital tag still on his wrist, I can see the on TV. Go you good thing.</p>
