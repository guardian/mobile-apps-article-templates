                    <p>It is extraordinarily difficult to make people stop in busy train stations. A virtuoso violinist can be <a href="https://www.snopes.com/music/artists/bell.asp">playing a masterpiece</a> on a $3.5m Stradivarius and most people will be so intent on making their train they won’t even slow down.</p>
                    <p>So it says something about Wynyard Station’s new artwork, Interloop, that people stop in their tracks mid-rush hour to look at it. </p>
                    <p>In 20 minutes either side of 9am on Tuesday, dozens of people slowed, stopped and gazed up at the four entwined loops of old wooden escalator stairs hanging above the concourse, curving over and under each other like a living <a href="x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/film/2010/jul/18/inception-film-review-philip-french">scene from Inception</a>. Office workers and public servants snapped pictures for social media, taking selfies with it or just staring: little islands of stillness in rivers of fast-walking travellers.</p>
                    <p>Ten-year-old Toby was entranced by it, grinning his head off as he craned his neck; he and is mother knew the project manager, John Sung, who died several months before the work was unveiled. Jessica and Nick, two 20-somethings on their way to work in Barangaroo, were delighted the wooden stairs “we used to take to work” were reappropriated rather than thrown away. </p>

                    <p>In real life and online, Interloop has already proven to be a success – at least from a PR point of view. On one level, that’s unsurprising. The timber escalators that comprise it are a part of bygone-Sydney folklore: the object of belated love other relics such as the monorail and the Sirius building came in for, en route to decommissioning. <a href="http://www.historyofsydney.com.au/the-wooden-escalators-at-wynyard-station/">First installed</a> in 1931, they were among only seven wooden escalators left in the world when they were removed last year. </p>
                    <p>From a health and safety perspective, an upgrade was overdue – they cause far more injuries than modern aluminium and stainless steel escalators, particularly to guide dogs, and pose more of a fire risk. But for the millions of people who used them over their lifespan, Wynyard’s wooden escalators retained a sentimental value. They were a charming anachronism in a city too eager to bulldoze its own history.</p>
                    <p>The reaction may also stem from a collective relief that, for the first time in years, central Sydney is beginning to look like something other than a bomb site. Interloop was unveiled the same week as a swathe of the new-look pedestrianised George Street, complete with light rail tracks, plant life and festively decorated anti-terror bollards. </p>

                    <p>People wander warily down the middle of the thoroughfare like they expect to be told off, cautiously testing out the vibe in a space once hostile to all non-wheeled forms of life.The gorgeous historic shopfronts so long overwhelmed by traffic – The Block, The Strand, the old Nock &amp; Kirby building – have their day in the sun again. </p>
                    <p>Even the benches are free of the metal armrests designed to stop homeless people sleeping on them: a growing fixture in a city where hostile architecture has steadily encroached on public spaces.</p>
                    <p>But there is another story to tell here: the story of how, in a city where taxpayer-funded artwork is one of the few things more despised than the public transport authority, a taxpayer-funded artwork commissioned by the public transport authority became a popular hit rather than the latest tabloid outrage. </p>
                    <p>Decrying various public art projects as evidence of spend-happy elitist zeal is one of the conservative establishment’s favourite weapons in the endless culture war against inner-city progressives. Broadcaster Alan Jones seemingly suggested hanging City of Sydney <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/news-and-views/alan-jones-accused-of-inciting-violence-against-women-in-cloud-arch-tweet-20170830-gy7q36.html">lord mayor Clover Moore</a> from the planned Cloud Arch sculpture on George Street in 2016. Moore’s proposed installation of a giant milk crate in Belmore Park, meanwhile, was indefinitely deferred after a canny Daily Telegraph subeditor labelled it “<a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/this-is-just-a-crate-big-waste-of-money-lord-mayor-clover-moores-latest-wacky-bid-for-more-public-art-in-sydney/news-story/8d3192dd8af1510dd55081d4aeafab26">a crate big waste of money</a>”.</p>

                    <p>More broadly, Australia’s relationship with public art can best be described as agnostic.

                    <p>But according to architect Chris Fox, who won a Transport for NSW design competition for the space at Wynyard, and has been working on Interloop since January, the agency had no hesitation about the work, despite the “very complicated” logistical, legal and safety compliance challenges it presented.</p>
                    <p>“It was pretty bold for Transport to do. I put this very ambitious project forward and they just got right behind it,” he says. “It was such a complex project, to make this thing hang there as though it were floating.”</p>
                    <p>Given the agency’s desperate need for a PR boost, going for broke on Interloop must have seemed worth the gamble. Controversial train timetable changes, plans to privatise bus services in the inner west and accusations that private contractors building the Sydney Metro Northwest are <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/nsw-government-contractors-accused-of-trying-to-slash-workers-pay-and-conditions-20170913-gygw11.html">exploiting workers</a> have done little to dispel the agency’s lingering nickname, CityFail.</p>

                    <p>In a city where the government’s highest fiscal priority is <a href="x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/australia-news/2017/dec/05/first-sydneys-stadiums-now-hordern-pavilion-site-slated-for-redevelopment">knocking down two football stadiums and building them again</a>; where old-age pensioners in public housing face uncertainty about where they’ll live out the rest of their years, <a href="x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/australia-news/2017/jul/12/i-feel-on-the-verge-of-extinction-the-battle-for-sydneys-waterloo">as their homes are flogged to developers</a>; and where <a href="x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/travel/2016/feb/20/sydney-lockouts-seven-creatives-give-their-views-and-none-of-them-are-good">public enjoyment in any capacity is stiflingly policed</a>, Interloop cuts against the grain. It will not drive up local house prices to ever more horrendous levels. It was not gifted to the city by a property plutocrat in exchange for a slice of prime public land. Along with George Street’s upgrade, it was built with the people in mind, and it stands out because so little else does.</p>
