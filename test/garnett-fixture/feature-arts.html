                <p>So it’s official. The Kevin Spacey scandal will not end House of Cards. In the first scene of the first episode of the next series, an underling will run into the Oval Office. “Did you hear what happened to Frank Underwood?” he’ll say, before explaining in great detail how a horse kicked him in the crotch and his balls went up into his mouth and exploded, and it made him fall off a kerb into a road where his face and neck were crushed by a fleet of steamrollers, a can-can troupe and an entire phalanx of Netflix board members. Then Claire Underwood will look directly into the camera, do finger guns, make a “click-click” noise out of the side of her mouth and the theme tune will kick in. Business as usual.</p>

<p><a href="x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/04/house-of-cards-to-resume-production-for-final-season-without-kevin-spacey">Netflix’s announcement that House of Cards will continue for one final eight-episode series</a> with Robin Wright in the lead is both good news and bad news. Let’s start with the good.</p> 
<p>First, and most practically, it takes an army to make a show like House of Cards, and this commitment to new episodes means that thousands of people won’t have to spend Christmas looking for new jobs. On a basic human level, that seems like the most decent thing to do.</p> 
<p>Second, Frank Underwood has been the worst thing about House of Cards for years. Once he’d blasted through all the juicy source material in the first series – and especially once he’d become president – he became listless and lost. The joy of watching him as an underdog was getting to see him climb the ladder, seducing and manipulating and murdering anyone who stood in his way. Underdog Underwood was a shark, a grandmaster constantly two moves ahead of everyone else. But once he achieved all his goals, he got bogged down in a morass of policy details, with no clear opponent left to define him. Really, from a simple storytelling perspective, he should have been killed off long ago; assassinated on the orders of his wife like in the books.</p> 
<p>Plus, you know, it’s short and it’ll wrap everything up neatly and we’ll get to see if there’s anything more to Claire Underwood than just a flattering haircut, a sense of cold detachment and a procession of Narnia-gone-executive outfits. Presumably there is, because otherwise the last pre-scandal episode wouldn’t have ended with her imperious “My turn” announcement, but we’ll have to see.</p> 
<p>On the downside, though, finding out will involve watching more House of Cards, and who has the time. It’s been on a downward curve for years now, but the last series in particular was awful. Visually flat, tonally monotonous and convoluted for the sake of being convoluted, it was genuinely painful to watch. The whole thing consisted of endless glum-looking people passing on endless reams of information to each other with exactly the same speed, volume and intonation as everyone else, over and over again, until your will to live quietly slipped out of your ear and made a bolt for the door. In absolutely no way whatsoever was it remotely interesting or dramatic or fun. It was, plain and simple, a stupid person’s idea of smart TV.</p> 
<p>And also, it’s House of Cards. Even without his participation, the whole thing will carry the stench of Kevin Spacey in every fibre of its being. It’ll still be informed by every decision he ever made, and his absence will always be the biggest thing onscreen. I’m all for separating art and the artist wherever I can, but getting excited about eight more hours of a show that seemed to knowingly allow Kevin Spacey’s pattern of abuse to flourish is going to take a hell of a run-up. So, in short, it’s good that House of Cards is coming back, but good luck trying to make me watch it.</p>
