                           <p>Hello there. Welcome here. Here’s what we’re dealing with today: Shakhtar Donetsk need to get at least a draw from this match (unless Napoli drop points against Feyenoord) in order to follow Manchester City into the knockout stages. So the Ukrainians will be pleased that City are already safely through as group winners and can treat this appointment like nothing more than one of those work bashes where you have to show your face before slinking off home. But is that really how City will approach this? They may have a big date with their neighbours in red this Sunday but they also have a proud unbeaten record to protect. </p>
                           <p>City have not lost in any competition this season and Pep Guardiola does not seem the sort to give up that record lightly, even if his lineup here is likely to bear little resemblance to the one that will face United. Surely a perfectionist such as Guardiola is aiming for invincibility this season? Real invincibility, not like Arsenal in 2003-04, when Arsene Wenger’s men were indomitable in the Premier League but lost six times in other competitions that season (seven if you include the Community Shield), including once in Ukraine (and twice in the League Cup to Steve McClaren’s Middlesbrough, for goodness sake). No, Guardiola won’t stand for any of that sort of caper. Expect him to seethe and gesticulate like a wild thing if his team don’t perform today. And since Shakhtar showed in the first half in Manchester that they are a slick side when in the groove. This, then, could be an entertaining affair all around.</p>
                           <p>So don’t go away! Pretty please. </p>

                           <p>As you can from the lists below, Guardiola has chucked a couple of rookies into his starting lineup. Tosin Adarabioyo is a 20-year-old centreback who has been at City since the age of five; and Phil Foden is one of the 17-year-olds who scaled to the top of the world with England recently - and today it looks as if he’s going to be deployed in Fabian Delph’s left-back/central midfield role. Or perhaps Danilo will go there and Fernandinho will slot in at right-back. The element of surprise is strong with this one ...</p>

                           <p>“I want to win the game. We have prepared seriously for that, with respect for the opponents and everybody.” About Shakhtar he says: “I came here with Barcelona and Bayern and it was always so so tough. Even with our normal lineup it would have been difficult because they have a lot of talent, with some Brazilian players and a Portuguese manager who I think will be one of the best in the future.”</p>
