                    <p>Pedro Almod&oacute;var has spoken out on his involvement in the Panama Papers, downplaying his importance in the leak.<br /></p>

                    </aside>
                    <p>The director was speaking at the Cannes film festival where his new film, Julieta, is playing in competition. Along with his brother, Almod&oacute;var was cited within the papers as having links to an offshore company in the 1990s.</p>
                    <p>“My name and my brother’s name are some of the least important names in the Panama papers,” he said. “If it was a film, we wouldn’t even be extras. The Spanish press has cast us in leading roles. There are so many names and there hasn’t been enough investigation yet.”</p>
                    <p>Almod&oacute;var had originally cancelled all press after the leak, later claiming that he considered himself <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/04/15/inenglish/1460704640_465892.html">“completely responsible”</a> for his involvement. After answering questions about his new film, the director was quizzed about the leak and responded, although the press conference moderator offered him the opportunity to skip the question.</p>
                    <p>The Spanish auteur is one of many major directors at the festival competing for the Palme d’Or; but two of his peers, Woody Allen and Steven Spielberg, have chosen to premiere their films out of competition. Last week, Allen said that he finds the idea of competing to be <a href="x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/film/2016/may/11/woody-allen-cannes-film-festival-cafe-society-artistic-competition">“against common sense”</a>. Almod&oacute;var admitted that he prefers the thrill of the race.</p>

                    <p>“I don’t have Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg’s talent,” he said. “I respect the posture that they have but if I’m here, I’d prefer to be in competition. I think it’s more exciting for me and the media. It also shows that I’m not a sacred cow here.”</p>
                    <p>His latest film, Julieta, is a melodrama based on short stories by Alice Munro about a woman looking back on her life and her fractured relationship with her daughter. He said he found affinity with Munro’s stories as she was a housewife and that is “basically” what he is too. Like many of his films, it’s set in Spain but the director revealed that it was originally set in the US, <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/meryl-streep-pedro-almodovar-movie">with Meryl Streep attached</a>.</p>
                    <p>“I was hoping to do the film in English and in New York,” he said. “I even spoke to an American actress who was delighted at the thought of working with me. But I wasn’t sure of myself.”</p>
                    <p>The film spans a considerable timeframe, with the bulk set in the 1980s; a decade that the director confesses is his favourite.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t feel like an old man, but I’m getting there,” he said. “I’m not a nostalgic person but I miss my youth and I miss the 80s.” He added: “Women in the 80s were very free. Women now are different because of the world they live in.”</p>
                    <p>At the age of 66, Almod&oacute;var said he’s still reluctant to spend time reflecting on his past, and would prefer it if writers did likewise. </p>
                    <p>“I do not want biographies, authorised or unauthorised, about me,” he said. “Please no one do it! I ask you to promise. Pass it on to future generations. My life is in these 20 films!”</p>
