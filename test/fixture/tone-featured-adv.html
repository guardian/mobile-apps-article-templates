                <h2><strong>Sean Conway, who swam the length of Britain</strong><br></h2>
                <p>One of my best adventures was swimming the length of Britain, from Land’s End to John O’Groats, in 2013. It had never been attempted before and took 4½ months in the sea. It was horrible, miserable: I was cold, hungry, wet and lost, much of the time. I call it “hindsight fun”, because it was an experience I’ll never forget. </p>
                <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">
                    <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/dec/25/in-praise-of-winter-swimming-uk-wild-swims?ArticleReferrer=RichLink">In praise of winter swimming: why it’s cool to take a dip on the wild side</a> </p>
                </aside>
                <p>Another tough but amazing adventure was the three peaks cycle challenge in 2012. A lot of people climb the three peaks (Snowdon, Scafell Pike and Ben Nevis) in 24 hours, but I cycled the 425 miles between them too, completing it in 60 hours. To prepare for this kind of adventure, you have to be really physically fit. Your body will cope with a lot more than you think it can, and if you put it under stress during training, you’ll be better prepared for the real thing. I always say that mileage makes champions, and I get as much mileage in before the adventure as I can. The same goes for mental preparation – I purposely put myself into stressful situations in the lead-up. I train alone, with no music, in the worst possible weather conditions. Then when things get tough, I think back to how much worse it was in training, and I know I’ll get through it.</p>
                <p>Everyone is challenged differently, but for me, an adventure has to contain an element of risk and uncertainty, has to be physically difficult and should also involve getting between two geographical locations..I love Britain; it’s a pretty awesome island. I’ll Instagram a picture from Scotland and people will say: “Wow, where are you?”, thinking I’m on the other side of the world. Last winter I kayaked the length of the Thames in a week, with a friend who had never kayaked in her life, camping along the way. I’d like to take a bus to Inverness with a blow-up kayak and a fold-up bike, kayak to Fort William along the Great Glen (62 miles), and cycle back. Even if you only have a week or two to spare, there are so many adventures to have in Britain.</p>

                <p>When I reflect on my adventures and try to put a finger on what ingredients make up the very best of them, I struggle. I loved being all alone and freezing cold as I cycled through the Andes. But I also relished sweating in too-close confines with three other blokes as we rowed across the Atlantic together. At times, adventure is the wilderness and the silence you find on a glacier in Iceland. At others, it’s the noise and confusion of navigating your way through the crowds of India.</p>

                <p>An adventure needs to have moments of difficulty and uncertainty. Strangely, a dollop of misery, worry and wishing I was back home usually goes a long way to cementing the good memories in my mind, long after the bad ones have faded. The technical name for this is “type 2 fun” – it’s there in all the best adventures!</p>

                <p>You don’t need to travel far to find adventure. Those in the crowded south of England can find it in the very next county to the one they live in. Adventure can be found anywhere that is new and different for <em>you</em>. To prove this, I once spent a brilliant week walking a lap of the M25! If you are looking for an adventure experience that will stay long in the memory, nothing beats a week or two on a bike, tent strapped to the back, exploring the back roads of rural England and working up an appetite for the next cafe break. The Jurassic coastline in Dorset is one of my favourite escapes, so too the dark sky emptiness of Exmoor. Simple, cheap, memorable. <br><span class="bullet">•</span><em> </em><a href="http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/blog/"><em>Alastair Humphreys</em></a><em> is a British adventurer who has blogged about UK </em><a href="http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/microadventures-3/"><em>microadventures</em></a><em>.

                <p>There was a 10-year span where I stayed in the UK and centred my adventures on swimming – despite the resurgence, water is still one of the world’s last uncharted territories. My top recommendation? Exploring the tarns of the Lake District. If you have children there are low-level tarns that warm up wonderfully in the sun and are easy to access and paddle in, such as <a href="http://wildswim.com/loughrigg-tarn">Loughrigg</a>, <a href="http://wildswim.com/rydal-water-cumbria">Rydal</a> and <a href="http://wildswim.com/easedale-tarn-cumbria">Easedale</a>. Wild campers can go further and lose contact for days, up on the peaks, and to swimming in the likes of <a href="http://wildswim.com/high-house-tarn">High House</a> and Sprinkling Tarn.</p>

                <p>The essential ingredients of a good adventure include a strong framework – a structure that drives the trip forward irrespective of discomfort or happiness. I know a retired couple who adventure every other year – last seen touring southern India doing homestays to learn Indian cooking. Unfamiliarity and exploration are essential. Anyone with young children knows that if you’re looking for something, be it badger holes or leaves, a walk becomes much more compelling.</p>
                <p>Adults are the same, but the two things you can’t search out are happiness and relaxation: these make holidays troublesome. It’s much better to just seek out cheap hostels while motorbiking around the country, then feel surprisingly recharged when you come home. An adventure is life-enhancing, not entirely frivolous, and you come back understanding something more about yourself and the world. </p>
                <p>I’m constantly doing harder and harder adventures. The next one is in April: a 12-week, 4,500-mile ironman triathlon in a top-secret location … Watch this space!</p>

                <p>A particular highlight was Orkney’s uninhabited Holm of Papay. There’s no boat service so I sweet-talked a friendly fisherman into dropping me on the island at dawn with a promise that he (almost certainly) wouldn’t forget to pick me up when he returned from the fishing. I spent a blissful day roaming about the island, accompanied by seals, eiders and arctic terns, and descended into a 5,000-year-old burial chamber.</p>
                <p>Adventure is largely a state of mind. No one ever had one while checking for phone reception or Wi-Fi, and simply by saying yes to everything you can often turn an ordinary holiday into an escapade. Try island-hopping in Orkney: buy an Island Explorer ferry ticket (seven-day ticket £42 adult, £21 child, bicycles free, <a href="http://orkneyferries.co.uk/">orkneyferries.co.uk</a>) and go wild camping, which is legal in Scotland. There are over a dozen islands to explore. You might end up on tiny Wyre, once a Viking chieftain’s stronghold; standing above Britain’s tallest cliff on Hoy; or sharing a dram with the locals on far off North Ronaldsay. Just don’t plan it all – serendipity is the best tour guide there is.</p>

                <p>Holidays are great. A chance to relax, take it easy. But me, I’d rather have an adventure. I don’t want to just go to a place but really interact with it, to get out of my comfort zone. People often make the mistake that Adventures – with a capital A – require a passport and a plane journey, but they’re wrong. Some of my most memorable adventures have been in Britain. </p>

                <p>From spending the night on a mountain top, to borrowing a canoe and paddling to an island in the Thames less than 20 miles from London for a weekend of solitude, some of my best adventures have been right here. Sometimes I like to do something bigger – like challenging myself to sleep at all the extreme points on the mainland – from the highest (Ben Nevis) to the lowest (Holme Fen in Cambridgeshire) and all the points of the compass.</p>
                <p>This year Wales is the place I’ll go. I’ll take a tent to tackle a section of the Cambrian Way, an unofficial (and unmarked) National Trail that crosses the country coast-to-coast (it’s also known as the Dragon’s Back) from Conwy to Cardiff. There are three options: the 180km south section that runs from Cardiff to Llandovery, taking in the escarpments and waterfalls of the Brecon Beacons; the 133km central section, crossing the little-visited wilderness of the Cambrian Mountains between Llandovery and Dinas Mawddwy; or the 142km northern end which takes in all the dramatic mountain ranges in Snowdonia before ending by the sea at Conwy Castle.</p>

                                    <p>West Wales is beautiful, even more so if you can catch it on one of the few dry, sunny days. Although enjoying a great view when the rain is pouring down can also be quite atmospheric... just make sure you have good waterproofs.</p>

                                    <p>The problem with life is that I was happily getting drunk every weekend until the kids magically appeared. Now I realise that these adventures appeal to me more and more, however the better half is less inclined to let me go off on weekend expeditions while the she looks after the kids. <br>*before you ask, she has no interest and the kids are too young.</p>

                                    <p>No such thing as too young. We had great adventures when they were tiny. Stay maybe in a cottage, or hotels, have a road trip, kayaking we managed when they were both under 3. With road trips we scheduled different things so one day it would be my interest, the next day his, another some kiddy wonderland.</p>
